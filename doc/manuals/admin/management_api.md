# Management REST interface

## Log and Trace levels
Apart from the NGSI interface, Orion Context Broker exposes a REST
API for management that allows to change the log level and the trace levels
(whose initial value is set using `-t` and `-logLevel` command line options).

To change the log level:

```
curl -X PUT <host>:<port>/admin/log?level=<NONE|FATAL|ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG>
```

To retrieve the log level:

```
curl <host>:<port>:/admin/log
```

which response follows the following pattern:

```
{
   "level": "INFO"
}
```



To manage the trace level:

```
curl --request DELETE <host>:<port>/log/trace
curl --request DELETE <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1
curl --request DELETE <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1-t2
curl --request DELETE <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1-t2,t3-t4
curl --request GET <host>:<port>/log/trace
curl --request PUT <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1
curl --request PUT <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1-t2
curl --request PUT <host>:<port>/log/trace/t1-t2,t3-t4
```

'PUT-requests' overwrite the previous log settings. So, in order to ADD
a trace level, a GET /log/trace must be issued first and after that the
complete trace string to be sent in the PUT request can be assembled.

### Tracelevel related with input/output payloads

The following traceleves are particularly useful in order to make Orion
print input/output payload in traces:

```
/* Input/Output payloads (180-199) */
  LmtServiceInputPayload = 180,
  LmtServiceOutPayload,
  LmtClientInputPayload,
  LmtClientOutputPayload = 183,  // Very important for harness test notification_different_sizes
  LmtPartialPayload,
  LmtClientOutputPayloadDump,
  LmtCPrForwardRequestPayload,
  LmtCPrForwardResponsePayload,
```

Thus, you can enable all them using:

```
curl --request PUT <host>:<port>/log/trace/180-199
```

## Semaphores
Another useful (especially if the broker stops responding correctly) REST API is
the semaphore listing offered:


```
curl <host>:<port>/admin/sem
```

The response is a listing of information of all the broker's semaphores:

```
{
    "alarmMgr": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "connectionContext": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "connectionEndpoints": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "dbConnection": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "dbConnectionPool": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "logMsg": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "metrics": {
        "status": "free"
     },
    "mqttMgr": {
        "status": "free"
     },
    "request": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "subCache": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "timeStat": {
        "status": "free"
    },
    "transaction": {
        "status": "free"
    }
}
```

Short explanation of the semaphores:
* **alarmMgr**, protects the data of the Alarm Manager 
* **connectionContext**, protects the curl context for sending HTTP notifications/forwarded messages
* **connectionEndpoints**, protects the curl endpoints when sending HTTP notifications/forwarded messages.
* **dbConnectionPool**, protects mongo connection pool
* **dbConnection**, protects the set of connections of the mongo connection pool
* **logMsg**, makes sure that not two messages are written simultaneously to the log-file
* **metrics**, protects internal data of the Metrics Manager
* **mqttMgr**, protects the data of MTTQ connections manager
* **request**, makes sure there are not two simultaneous requests to mongodb 
* **subCache**, protects the Subscription Cache
* **timeStat**, protects the data for timing statistics
* **transaction**, protects the Transaction ID (for the log-file)

The information supplied for each of the semaphores is:
* status:  `free` or `taken`

[ For now only one item per semaphore but the idea is to add more information in the future ]
