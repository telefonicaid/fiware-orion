# <a name="top"></a>Semaphores
Orion manages a number of semaphores for protection of delicate data and resources such as

* [Mongo requests](#mongo-request-semaphore)
* [Transaction ID](#transaction-id-semaphore)
* [Subscription cache](#subscription-cache-semaphore)
* [Timing statistics](#timing-statistics-semaphore)
* [Mongo connection pool](#mongo-connection-pool-semaphores)
* [Metrics Manager](#metrics-manager-semaphore)
* [Alarm Manager](#alarm-manager-semaphore)
* [MQTT Connection Manager](#mqtt-connection-manager-semaphore)
* [Log file](#log-file-semaphore)
* [Notification queue](#notification-queue-semaphore)
* [Notification queue statistics](#notification-queue-statistics-semaphore)

Of these semaphores, the first four use helper functions in `lib/common/sem.[cpp|h]`, while the others are part of their respective structure/class.

## Mongo request semaphore
The *Mongo request semaphore* resides in `lib/common/sem.cpp` and its semaphore variable is `reqSem`. The functions to take/give the semaphore are `reqSemTake()` and `reqSemGive()`.

The function `reqSemTake()` is somewhat special as there are four different working modes for the Mongo request semaphore:

* None
* Only for **read** operations
* Only for **write** operations
* Both **read and write** operations

"None" meaning that the semaphore isn't used.

The operation mode of this semaphore is set using the [CLI option](../admin/cli.md) `-reqMutexPolicy`. Default value is "Both Read and Write operations". More information on mutex policy in [this section of the Orion administration manual](../admin/perf_tuning.md#mutex-policy-impact-on-performance).

This semaphore is used for each and every request to the database **only** by top level functions of [**mongoBackend**](sourceCode.md#srclibmongobackend), i.e. those functions that are external and called by service routines.

## Transaction ID semaphore
The *transaction ID semaphore* resides in `lib/common/sem.cpp` and its semaphore variable is `transSem`. The functions to take/give the semaphore are  `transSemTake()` and `transSemGive()`.

Each REST request that Orion receives is given a unique **transaction ID**.  

To ensure a unique identifier of the transaction, the `startTime` of the broker (down to milliseconds) is used as prefix (to almost guarantee its uniqueness among brokers). Also, a running number for the transaction is appended to the identifier.

A 32 bit signed number is used, so its max value is 0x7FFFFFFF (2,147,483,647). If the running number overflows, a millisecond is added to the start time of the broker. As the running number starts from 1 again after overflow, we need this to distinguish the first transaction after a running number overflow from the VERY first transaction (as both will have running number 1).
Imagine that the start time of the broker is XXXXXXXXX.123:

* XXXXXXXXX.123.1 -> the VERY first transaction
* XXXXXXXXX.124.1 -> the first transaction after running number overflow

The whole thing is stored in the thread variable `transactionId`, supplied by the [**logMsg** library](sourceCode.md#srcliblogmsg) logging library.

Now, The **running number** needs to be protected when incremented and this semaphore is used for that purpose.

See the function `transactionIdSet()` in the file `lib/common/globals.cpp`.

## Subscription cache semaphore
The *subscription cache semaphore* resides in `lib/common/sem.cpp` and its semaphore variable is `cacheSem`. The functions to take/give the semaphore are `cacheSemTake()` and `cacheSemGive()` and they are used by functions in two different libraries:

* [**lib/mongoBackend**](sourceCode.md#srclibmongobackend) and
* [**lib/cache**](sourceCode.md#srclibcache)

Due to the implementation of the subscription cache, *especially how it is refreshed*, this semaphore cannot be taken/given in low level functions of the cache library, as one would normally do this, but rather in higher level functions, which makes the implementation a little bit tricky.
Any changes in where this semaphore is taken/given needs careful consideration.

Details on this semaphore is already present in the [dedicated document of the subscription cache](subscriptionCache.md). Pay special attention to the semaphore considerations explained in the [section devoted to `subCacheSync()` function](subscriptionCache.md#subcachesync).

## Timing Statistics Semaphore
The *timing statistics semaphore* resides in `lib/common/sem.cpp` and its semaphore variable is `timeStatSem`. The functions to take/give the semaphore are `timeStatSemTake()` and `timeStatSemGive()`.

Timing Statistics were invented as a tool to detect bottlenecks in run-time but as system-calls are used to measure time, this impacts the performance of Orion so it has been made optional, by default OFF but can be turned ON using the [CLI parameter](../admin/cli.md) `-statTiming`.

The statistics measurements are collected by the function `requestCompleted()` in `lib/rest/rest.cpp` and put together in `lib/common/statistics.cpp`, function `renderTimingStatistics()`. Both these functions use the semaphore, obviously. It is not used anywhere else.

## Mongo connection pool semaphores
Orion implements a [pool for connections to the database](mongoBackend.md#connection-pool-management), and this pool needs protection by a semaphore to obtain/release connections.

Actually, two semaphores are used. The variables holding these two semaphores are:

* `connectionPoolSem`
* `connectionSem`

and they are initialized in `mongoConnectionPoolInit()` in `lib/mongoBackend/mongoConnectionPool.cpp`, and taken/given in two functions of the same file:

* `mongoPoolConnectionGet()`
* `mongoPoolConnectionRelease()`

The variables holding the semaphores are static and thus cannot be accessed outside this file (`lib/mongoBackend/mongoConnectionPool.cpp`).

This is how the Mongo Connection Pool is protected:

* A binary semaphore protects the pool itself (`connectionPoolSem`).
* A counting semaphore makes the caller wait until there is a free connection (`connectionSem`).

There is a limited number of connections and the first thing to do is to wait for a connection to become available (any of the N connections in the pool). This is done by waiting on the counting semaphore that is initialized with "POOL SIZE", meaning the semaphore can be taken N times if the pool size is N.

Once a connection is available, `sem_wait(&connectionSem)` returns and we now have to take the semaphore that protects the pool itself (we *are* going to modify the vector of the pool, can only do it in one thread at a time)

After taking a connection, the semaphore `connectionPoolSem` is given, as all modifications to the connection pool have finished. The other semaphore however, `connectionSem`, is kept and it is not given until we finish using the connection.

The function `mongoPoolConnectionRelease()` releases the counting semaphore `connectionSem`.
Very important to call the function `'mongoPoolConnectionRelease()'` after finishing using the connection.

## Metrics Manager semaphore
The Metrics Manager needs a semaphore to protect its list of metrics and this semaphore is a private member of the class `MetricsManager`, called `sem`. Two, also private methods have been developed to access the semaphore:

* `MetricsManager::semTake()`
* `MetricsManager::semGive()`

As the methods are private, they can only be accessed by the instance of `MetricsManager` class, which is a singleton in Orion.

The semaphore is used whenever the metrics list is read or updated, which is done by four of the methods of `MetricsManager` and nowhere else:

* `MetricsManager::add()`
* `MetricsManager::release()`
* `MetricsManager::reset()`
* `MetricsManager::toJson()`

## Alarm Manager semaphore
The Alarm Manager is pretty similar to the Metrics Manager, and its semaphore follows the same pattern. The class `AlarmManager` has a private field called `sem` and methods:

* `AlarmManager::semTake()`
* `AlarmManager::semGive()`

The semaphore protects the list of alarms and is accessed by the following methods:

* `notificationErrorLogAlwaysSet()`
* `badInputLogAlwaysSet()`
* `dbErrorLogAlwaysSet()`
* `dbError()`
* `dbErrorReset()`
* `notificationError()`
* `notificationErrorReset()`
* `badInput()`
* `badInputReset()`

**Note:** The Alarm Manager semaphore is private in the class `AlarmManager`, **but** the methods `semTake()` and `semGive()` are **public**. This is a mistake, the methods should be private as well. They are only called from within methods of `AlarmManager`, so, no problem in making the methods private.

## MQTT Connection Manager semaphore
The MQTT Connection Manager is pretty similar to the Metrics Manager, and its semaphore follows the same pattern. The class `MqttConnectionManager` has a private field called `sem` and methods:

* `MqttConnectionManager::semTake()`
* `MqttConnectionManager::semGive()`

The semaphore protects the access to the connections hashmap and is accessed by the following methods:

* `sendMqttNotification()`
* `cleanup()`

## Log file semaphore
Orion keeps a log file and a semaphore is needed to protect the log file from two threads writing to it at the same time. The variable holding this semaphore is called `sem` and it resides in `lib/logMsg/logMsg.cpp`. It is a static variable so it is not visible outside this file.

The semaphore is initialized in the function `lmSemInit()` and used in the two static functions `semTake()` and `semGive()`, which in their turn are used in:

* `lmOut()`
* `lmClear()`

## Notification queue semaphore
When thread pools are used (using the [CLI parameter](../admin/cli.md) `-notificationMode`), for sending of notifications, a queue is used to feed the notifications to the workers in the thread pool. This queue is protected by a semaphore.
If several queues are used (i.e. a default queue and a per-service queues) then a semaphore exists in each queue.

The semaphore, of type `boost::mutex`, is called `mtx` and it is a private member of the class `SyncQOverflow`, found in `src/lib/common/SyncQOverflow.h`:

```
template <typename Data> class SyncQOverflow
{
private:
  std::queue<Data>           queue;
  mutable boost::mutex       mtx;
  boost::condition_variable  addedElement;
  size_t                     max_size;

public:
  SyncQOverflow(size_t sz): max_size(sz) {}
  bool     try_push(Data element);
  Data     pop();
  size_t   size() const;
};
```
Both classes `QueueWorkers` and `ServiceQueue` include a private member of type `SyncQOverflow`, while the class `ServiceQueue` also includes a private member of type `QueueWorkers`.
Class `QueueNotifier` may include a vector of per-service `ServiceQueue` and also a default `ServiceQueue` (for notifications not associated to any service with reserved queue).

Finally, `contextBrokerInit()` in `src/app/contextBroker/contextBroker.cpp` creates an instance of `QueueNotifier` as a singleton, when requested (when CLI parameter `-notificationMode` equals **threadpool**).

The method `try_push()` of the template class `SyncQOverflow` takes this semaphore before pushing items to the notification queue and likewise the method `pop()` takes it before popping an element.

This semaphore protects pushing and popping to the notification queue. However, there is a need for a mechanism to wait for items in the queue as well and for this purpose a `boost::condition_variable` called `addedElement` is used. `addedElement` is a private member of the class `SyncQOverflow`.

## Notification queue statistics semaphore
The statistics of the Notification Queue is protected by the semaphore `mtxTimeInQ` in `lib/ngsiNotify/QueueStatistics.cpp`. This semaphore is of the type `boost::mutex` and it is used whenever the timing statistics of the Notification Queue is modified/queried:

* `QueueStatistics::getTimeInQ()`
* `QueueStatistics::addTimeInQWithSize()`
* `QueueStatistics::getQSize()`
* `QueueStatistics::reset()`
