# Geolocation capabilities

NGSIv2 allows to filter by geographical location, e.g. all the entities located
closer than 15 km from the center of Madrid. Of course, properly located entities are mandatory.

Both topics (entity location and geographical queries) are dealt in detail in
the "Geospacial properties of entities" and "Geographical Queries" sections of the
[NGSIv2 specification](http://telefonicaid.github.io/fiware-orion/api/v2/stable/).
