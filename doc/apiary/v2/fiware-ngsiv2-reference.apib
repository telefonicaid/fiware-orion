# Specification

## Introduction

The FIWARE NGSI (Next Generation Service Interface) API defines 

* a **data model** for context information, based on a simple information model using the notion of *context entities*
* a **context data interface** for exchanging information by means of query, subscription, and update operations
* a **context availability interface** for exchanging information on how to obtain context information
(whether to separate the two interfaces is currently under discussion).
* a set of typical **roles** played by NGSI-compliant components

## Terminology

### Context data modelling and exchange

#### Context Entities

Context entities, or simply called entities, are the center of gravity
in the FIWARE NGSI information model. An entity represents a
real-world object like e.g. a sensor, a person, or a room. Each entity
is uniquely identified by its **entity id**. 

Furthermore, the type system of FIWARE NGSI enables entities to have 
an **entity type**. Entity types are semantic types; they are intended
to describe the type of real-world object represented by the entity.
For example, a context entity with id *sensor-365* could have the
type *temperatureSensor*.

#### Context Elements

*(Note: the distinction between context entities and context elements 
is still under discussion; therefore the notion of context elements
currently only appears in this section.)*

A context element is a data object (e.g. JSON object; see the section
on JSON representation below) which contains information about a
specific context entity. Consequently, a context element has a
mandatory property `id` in order to identify the context entity it
refers to. It furthermore can contain an optional property `type`
to describe the type of the entity. Further properties can be used
to represent more information about the entity (see the **context
attributes** section below).

It is important to understand that the relationship of entity and context element is one-to-many. This means that 
* each context element refers to exactly one entity
* there can be several context elements  referring to the same entity. The context elements can for example contain
different pieces of information about the entity

#### Context Attributes 

Context attributes are properties of context entities.
For example, the current speed of a car could be modeled as
attribute *current_speed* of entity *car-104*.

In the NGSI data model, attributes have an *attribute name*,
an *attribute type*, an *attribute value* and *metadata*. 
 * The attribute name describes which kind of property of the entity the attribute value represents, for example *current_speed*.
 * The attribute type represents the NGSI value type of the attribute value.
 Note that FIWARE NGSI has its own type system for attribute values, so NGSI value types are not the same as JSON types.
 * The attribute value finally contains
  * the actual data
  * optional **metadata** describing properties of the attribute value like e.g. accuracy, provider, or a timestamp
  
#### Context Metadata

Context metadata is used in FIWARE NGSI at several places, one of
them being an optional part of the attribute value as described
above. Similarly to attributes, each piece of metadata has 
 * **a metadata name**, describing the role of the metadata at the
 place where it occurs; for example, the metadata name *accuracy* 
 indicates that the metadata value describes how accurate a given 
 attribute value is
 * a **metadata type**, describing the NGSI value type of the metadata value
 * a **metadata value** containing the actual metadata

Note that in NGSI it is not foreseen that metadata values can
themselves have metadata.

## JSON Entity Representation

An entity is represented by a JSON object with the following syntax:

* The entity id is specified by the object's `id` property, which value is a string containing the entity id.

* The entity type is specified by the object's `type` property, which value is a string containing the entity's type name.

* Entity attributes are specified by additional properties, which name is the `name` of the attribute and which representation
  is described in the JSON Attribute Representation section below. Obviously, `id` and `type` are not allowed as attribute names.

An example of this syntax in shown below:

```
{
  "id": "entityID",
  "type": "entityType",
  "attr_1": <val_1>,
  "attr_2": <val_2>,
  ...
  "attr_N": <val_N>
}
```

The normalized representation of entities always include `id`, `type` and the properties which represent attributes. However, simplified
or partial representations (see below at Partial Representations section), may leave out some of them. The specification of each operation
includes details about what  representation is expected as input or what representation will be provided (rendered) as output.

## JSON Attribute Representation

An attribute is represented by a JSON object with the following syntax:

* The attribute value is specified by the `value` property, which value may be any JSON datatype.

* The attribute NGSI type is specified by the `type` property, which value is a string containing the NGSI type.

* The attribute metadata is specified by the `metadata` property. Its value is another JSON object which will contain a
  property per metadata element defined (the name of the property is the `name` of the metadata element). Each metadata element,
  in turn, is represented by a JSON object containing the following properties:

  * `value`: Its value will contain the metadata value, which may correspond to any JSON datatype.

  * `type`: Its value will contain a string representation of the metadata NGSI type.

An example of this syntax in shown below:

```
{
  "value": <...>,
  "type": <...>,
  "metadata": <...>
}
```

## Simplified Entity Representation

There are two representation modes, which must be supported by implementations, and which allow to generate simplified representations of entities.

* *keyValues* mode. This mode represents each entity attribute only by its value, leaving out the information about type and metadata.
  Thus, when this mode is on, only the attribute value is represented and will correspond to the value of the property which represents the attribute.
  See example below.

```
{
   "id": "R12345",
   "type": "Room",
   "temperature": 22
}
```

* *values mode*. This mode represents the entity only by a collection of attribute values conveyed by an Array. Id and type information are left out.
  See example below. The order of the attributes in the Array is specified by the `attrs` URI param (e.g. `attrs=branch,colour,engine`) or arbitrary
  order in the case `attrs` is not used.

```
[ 'Ford', 'black', 78.3 ]
```

* *unique mode*. This mode is just like *values mode*, with the only difference that values are not repeated.

## Partial Representations

Some operations imply that only a partial representation of an entity will be provided, which are summarized below:

* `id` and `type` are not allowed in update operations, as they are inmutable properties.

* In the requests in which entity `type` is allowed, it may be omitted. When omitted, the default string value `none`
  is used for the type.

* In some cases, not all the attributes of the entity are shown, e.g. a query which selects a subset of entity attributes.

* Attribute/metadata `value` may be omitted in requests, meaning that the attribute/metadata has `null` value. It is always present in responses.

* Attribute/metadata `type` may be ommitted in requests. When omitted, the default string value `none`.

* Attribute `metadata` may be ommitted in requests, meaning that there are not metadata elements associated to the attribute. In responses, this property is set to
  `{}` if the attribute doesn't have metadata.


## Special attribute types

Generally speaking, user-defined attribute types are informative, they are processed by the NGSIv2 server in
an opaque way. Nonetheless, the types described below are used to convey an special meaning

* `date`:  identifies dates, in ISO8601 format. These attributes can be used with the
  greater than, less than, greater or equal, lesser or equal and range query operators. For instance
  (only the referred entity attribute is shown) :

```
{
  "timestamp": {
    "value": "2017-06-17T07:21:24.238Z",
    "type: "date"
  }
}
```

## Virtual attributes

There are entity properties that are not directly modificable by NGSIv2 clients, but that can be rendered
by NGSIv2 servers to provide extra information. From a representation point of view, they are like
regular attributes, with name, value and type.

Virtual attributes are not rendered by default. In oder to render an specific attribute, add its name
to the `options` URL parameter.

The list of virtual attributes is the following:

* `dateCreation` (type: `date`): entity creation date as ISO 8601 string.
* `dateModification` (type: `date`): entity modification date as ISO 8601 string.

As regular attributes, they can be  used in `attrs`, `q` filters and `orderBy`. However, they cannot be used
in resource URLs.


## Field syntax restrictions

Fields used as identifiers in the NGSIv2 API follow special rules regarding allowed syntax. These rules applies to:

* Entity id
* Entity type
* Attribute name
* Attribute type
* Metadata name
* Metadata type

The rules are:

* Allowed characters are the ones in the plain ASCII set except the following ones: control characters, whitespace, `&`, `?`, `/` and `#`.
* Maximum field length is 256 characters.
* Minimum field length is 1 character.

In addition to the above rules, given NGSIv2 server implementations could add additional syntactical restrictions in those
or other fields, e.g. to avoid some cross script injection attacks.

In the case a client attemps to use a field not valid from a syntax point of view, it shall get a "Bad Request" error
explaining the cause.

## Atrribute names restrictions

The following strings must not be used as attribute names:

* `id`, as it would conflict to the field used to represent entity id)

* `type`, as it would conflict to the field used to represent entity type)

* `geo:distance`, as it would conflict with the string used in `orderBy` for proximity to center point.

* Virtual attribute names (see specific section about virtual attributes)

## Ordering results

Operations that retrieve lists of entities allow the `orderBy` URI parameter to specify the order; its 
value can be:

* The keyword geo:distance to order results by distance to a reference geometry when a "near" (`georel=near`) spatial 
  relationship is used. 

* A comma-separated list of attributes (including virtual attributes), e.g. `temperature,!humidity`. Results are ordered
  by the first attribute. On ties, the results are ordered by the second attribute and so on. A "!" before the attribute
  name means that the order is reversed.

## Error responses

In the case of being present, the error payload is JSON object including the following fields:

+ `error` (required, string): a textual description of the error.
+ `description` (optional, string): additional information about the error.
+ `affectedItems` (optional, array[string]): a list of elements affected by the error. Depending on the operation, it may
  refer to entities, registrations or subscriptions.

Error list (HTTP response code in parenthesis):

* ParseError            (`400`). The incoming JSON payload cannot be parsed.
* BadRequest            (`400`). The incoming request is invalid in this context.
* NotFound              (`404`). The Context Element referred in the request has not been found.
* TooManyResults        (`409`). There are several results that match with the resource identification used
  in the request. This typically the case of requesting an entity with not enough information and the
  solution is to enhance entity identification adding more information, e.g. adding entity type
  and/or service path.
* LengthRequired        (`411`). Zero/No Content-Length in PUT/POST/PATCH request.
* RequestEntityTooLarge (`413`). Payload is too large.
* UnsupportedMediaType  (`415`). Request content type is not supported.
* InvalidModification   (`422`). Some piece of information is missing in payload.
* NotSupportedQuery     (`422`). The implementation does not support the query issued.
* NoResourcesAvailable  (`413`). There are no server resources to fulfill the client request. 

## Geospatial properties of entities

The geospatial properties of a context entity can be represented by means of regular context attributes.
The provision of geospatial properties enables the resolution of geographical queries.

Two different syntaxes must be supported by compliant implementations: 

* *Simple Location Format*. It is meant as a very lightweight format that developers and users can quickly
and easily add to their existing entities with little effort.

* *GeoJSON*.  [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-butler-geojson-06)
is a geospatial data interchange format based on the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). GeoJSON provides greater flexibility
allowing the representation of point altitudes or even more complex geospatial shapes, for instance
[multi geometries](http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html#multi-geometries).

Client applications are responsible for defining which entity attributes convey geospatial properties (by providing
an appropriate NGSI attribute type). Typically it will be an entity attribute named `location`,
but nothing prevents use cases where an entity contains more than one geospatial attribute. For instance,
locations specified at different granularity levels or provided by different location methods with different accuracy. 
Nonetheless, it is noteworthy the fact that spatial properties
need special indexes which can be under resource constraints imposed by backend databases.
Thus, implementations may raise errors when spatial index limits are exceeded.
The recommended HTTP status code for those situations is ``413``, *Request entity too large*, and the reported error
on the response payload must be ``NoResourcesAvailable``.

*Note: At the time of writing it is still under discussion if supporting both syntaxes is really needed* 

### Simple Location Format

Simple Location Format supports basic geometries ( *point* , *line* , *box* , *polygon* ) and covers the typical
use cases when encoding geographical locations. It has been inspired by [GeoRSS Simple](http://www.georss.org/simple.html).

It is noteworthy that the Simple Location Format is not intended to represent complex positions on Earth surface.
For instance, those applications which require to capture altitude coordinates will have to use GeoJSON as
representation format for the geospatial properties of their entities. 

A context attribute  which represents a location encoded using the Simple Location Format
must conform to the following syntax:

* The attribute type must be one of the following values: (`geo:point`, `geo:line`, `geo:box` or `geo:polygon`).
* The attribute value must be a list of coordinates. By default coordinates will be defined
using the [WGS84 Lat Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84),
[EPSG::4326](http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326) coordinate reference system (CRS),
with latitude and longitude units of decimal degrees. Such coordinate list will allow to encode the geometry
specified by the `type` attribute and will be encoded according with the specific rules defined below:

  * Type `geo:point`:   the attribute value must contain a string containing a
  valid latitude-longitude pair, separated by a comma. 
  * Type `geo:line`:    the attribute value must contain a string array of
  valid latitude-longitude pairs. There must be at least two pairs.
  * Type `geo:polygon`: the attribute value must contain a string array
  of valid latitude-longitude pairs.
There must be at least four pairs, with the last being identical to the first
(so a polygon has a minimum of three actual points).
Coordinate pairs should be properly ordered so that the line segments
that compose the polygon remain on the ​outer ​edge of the area defined.
For instance, the following path, ```[0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2, 2]```, is an example of an invalid polygon definition. 
Implementations should raise an error when none of the former conditions are met by input data. 
  * Type `geo:box`:     A bounding box is a rectangular region, often used to define the extents of a map or
a rough area of interest. A box is represented by a two-length string array of latitude-longitude pairs.
The first pair is the lower corner, the second is the upper corner.

Note: Circle geometries are not supported, as the [literature](https://github.com/geojson/geojson-spec/wiki/Proposal---Circles-and-Ellipses-Geoms#discussion-notes)
describes different shortcomings for implementations. 

The examples below illustrate the referred syntax:

```
{
  "location": {
    "value": "41.3763726, 2.186447514",
    "type": "geo:point"
  }
}
```

```
{
  "location": {
    "value": [
              "40.63913831188419, -8.653321266174316",
              "40.63881265804603, -8.653149604797363"
    ],
    "type": "geo:box"
  }
}
```

### GeoJSON

A context attribute which represents a location encoded using GeoJSON must conform to the following syntax:

* The NGSI type of the attribute must be the MIME type assigned by IETF to the GeoJSON format.
Currently 'application/vnd.geo+json'.
* The attribute value must be a valid GeoJSON object. It is noteworthy that longitude comes first in GeoJSON coordinates.

The example below illustrates the usage of GeoJSON.
More GeoJSON examples can be found at [GeoJSON IETF Spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-butler-geojson-06#page-14).
Additionally, the following [GeoJSON Tutorial](http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html)
can be useful in urderstanding the format. 

```
{
  "location": {
    "value": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [2.186447514, 41.3763726]
    },
    "type": "application/vnd.geo+json"
  }
}
```

## Simple Query Language

The Simple Query Language provides a simplified syntax to retrieve entities which match a set of conditions.
A query is composed by a list of statements separated by the ';' character. Each statement express a matching condition.
The query will return all the entities which match all the matching conditions (AND logical operator). 

There are two kind of statements: *unary statements* and *binary statements*.

Binary statements are composed by an attribute name (e.g. "temperature"), operator and value (which format
depends on the operator), e.g.:

```
temperature==50
temperature<=20
```

The list of operators (and the format of the values they use) is as follows:

+ **Equal**: `==`. It accepts the following values:
    + Single element, e.g. `temperature==40`. It matches entities whose attribute value
      that exact value.
    + A list of comma-separated values, e.g. `color==black,red`. It matches entities whose
      attribute value is one of the values (OR clause). Eg. entities which `color` is set to
      `black` will match, while entities which `color` is set to `white` will not match.
    + A range, specified as a minimum and maximum separated by `..`. It matches if
      the value is in the interval between the minimum and the maximum (both included). It can only be used
      with attributes which contain dates (ISO8601 format) or numbers. E.g. `temperature==10..20` matchs if the
      temperature is greater or equal than 10 and lower or equal than 20.
+ **Unequal**: `!=`. It accepts the following values:
      + The value is a single element, e.g. `temperature!=40`. It matches entities whose attribute
      value is not that exact value.
      + A list of comma-separated values, e.g. `color!=black,red`. It matches entities whose
      attribute value is not any of the values (AND clause). Eg. entities whose `color` is set
      to `black` will not match, while entities whose `color` is set to `white`will match.
      + A range, specified as a minimum and maximum separated by `..`. It matches
      if the value is not in the interval between the minimum and the maximum (both included). It can only
      be used with attributes which contain dates (ISO8601 format) or numbers. E.g. `temperature!=10..20` matches if
      the temperature is lower than 10 or greater than 20 (it will not match if the tempeature is 10 or the
      temperature is 20).
+ **Greater than**: `>`. The value is a single element, e.g. `temperature>40`. It
  matches entities which attribute value is strictly greater than that value. It only makes sense when
  used with attributes which contain dates or numbers (using with attributes of other type might lead to
  unexpected results).
+ **Less than**: `<`. The value is a single element, e.g. `temperature<40`. It
  matches entities which attribute value is strictly less than that value. It only makes sense when
  used with attributes which contain dates or numbers (using with attributes of other type might lead to
  unexpected results).
+ **Greater or equal than**: `>=`. The value is a single element, e.g. `temperature>=40`.
  It matches entities which attribute value is greater than or equal to that value. It only makes sense when
  used with attributes which contain dates or numbers (using with attributes of other type might lead to
  unexpected results).
+ **Less or equal than**: `<=`. The value is a single element, e.g. `temperature<=40`. It
  matches entities which attribute value is less than or equal to that value. It only makes sense when
  used with attributes which contain dates or numbers (using with attributes of other type might lead to
  unexpected results).

In the case of equal or unequal, if the value to match include a `,`, you can use simple quote
(`'`), e.g: `color=='light,green','deep,blue'`.

Unary negatory statements use the unary operator `!`, while affirmative unary statements use no operator at all.
The unary statements are used to check for attribute existence. E.g. `temperature` matches entities that have
an attribute called 'temperature' (no matter its value), while `!temperature` matches entities that do not have
a temperature attribute.
  
 
## Geographical Queries

Geographical queries are specified by means of the following parameters:

``georel`` is intended to specify a spatial relationship (a predicate)
between matching entities and a reference shape (`geometry`).
It is composed of a token list separated by ';'.
The first token is the relationship name, the rest of tokens (if any) are modifiers which
provide more information about such a relationship. The following values are allowed:

+ `georel=near`. The ``near`` relationship means that matching entities must be located at certain threshold
distance to the reference geometry. It supports the following modifiers:
  + `maxDistance`.  Express, in meters, the maximum distance at which matching entities must be located.
  + `minDistance`.  Express, in meters, the minimum distance at which matching entities must be located.
+ `georel=coveredBy`. Denotes that matching entities are those which exist entirely within the reference geometry.
When resolving this query the border of a shape must be considered to be part of the shape. 
+ `georel=intersects`. Denotes that matching entities will be those intersecting with the reference geometry.
+ `georel=equals`. The geometry associated to the position of matching entities
and the reference geometry must be exactly the same.
+ `georel=disjoint`. Denotes that matching entities will be those NOT intersecting with the reference geometry. 

`geometry` allows to define the reference shape to be used when resolving the query.
 The following geometries (see Simple Location Format) must be supported:

+ `geometry=point`, defines a point on the Earth surface.
+ `geometry=line`, defines a polygonal line.
+ `geometry=polygon`, defines a polygon.
+ `geometry=box`, defines a bounding box.

**coords** must be a string containing a semicolon separated list of pairs of geographical coordinates
in accordance with the geometry specified and the rules mandated by the Simple Location Format:

* `geometry=point`.   `coords` will contain a pair of WGS-84 geo-coordinates.
* `geometry=line`.    `coords` will contain a list of pairs of WGS-84 geo-coordinates.
* `geometry=polygon`. `coords` will be composed by at least four pairs of WGS-84 geo-coordinates.
* `geometry=box`.     `coords` will be composed by two pairs of WGS-84 geo-coordinates.

Examples:

`georel=near;maxDistance:1000&geometry=point&coords=-40.4,-3.5`.
Matching entities will be located, at a maximum, 1000 meters far away from the reference point.

`georel=near;minDistance:5000&geometry=point&coords=-40.4,-3.5`.
Matching entities will be at least 5000 meters far away from the reference point. 

`georel=coveredBy&geometry=polygon&coords=25.774,-80.190;18.466,-66.118;32.321,-64.757;25.774,-80.190`
Matching entities will be those located within the referred polygon.

### Query Resolution

If an implementation is not able to resolve a geographical query, the HTTP Status code of the response
must be ```422```, *Unprocessable Entity*. The error name present in the error payload must be
``NotSupportedQuery``. 

When resolving geographical queries, through the Simple Query Language,
the API implementation is responsible for determining which entity attribute
contains the geographical location to be used for matching purposes.
To this aim, the following rules must be followed:

* If an entity has no attribute which corresponds to a location (encoded as GeoJSON or the
Simple Location Format), then such an entity has not declared any geospatial property and will not match any
geographical query.

* If an entity only exposes one attribute corresponding to a location, then such an attribute will be used when
resolving geographical queries.

* If an entity exposes more than one location, then the attribute which contains a metadata property
named ``defaultLocation``, with boolean value ``true``
will be taken as the reference location used for resolving geographical queries.

* If there is more than one attribute exposing location but none of them has been labeled as being the
default location, then the query will be declared as ambigous and an HTTP error response with code ``409``
must be sent.

* If there is more than one attribute exposing location which has been labeled as being the
*default location*, then the query will be declared as ambigous and an HTTP error response with code ``409``
must be sent. 

## Notification messages

Notifications include two fields:

* `subscriptionId` which represents the concerned subscription that originates the notification
* `data` an array with the notification data itself which includes the entity and attributes concerned. Each
  element in the array corresponds to a different entity. By default each entity will be represented in
  normalized mode. However by using the `attrsFormat` modifier it can be requested a simplified representation.

If `attrsFormat` is `normalized` (or if `attrsFormat` is omitted) then default entity representation is used:

```
{
   "subscriptionId": "12345",
   "data": [
     {
       "id": "Room1",
       "type": "Room",
       "temperature": {
         "value": 23,
         "type": "none",
         "metadata": {}
       },
       "humidity": {
         "value": 70,
         "type": "percentage",
         "metadata": {}
       }
     },
     {
     "id": "Room2",
     "type": "Room",
     "temperature": {
       "value": 24,
       "type": "none",
       "metadata": {}
     }
   ]
}
```

If `attrsFormat` is `keyValues` then keyValues entity partial representation mode is used:

{
   "subscriptionId": "12345",
   "data": [
     {
       "id": "Room1",

If `attrsFormat` is `values` then values entity partial representation mode is used:

```
{
   "subscriptionId": "12345",
   "data": [ [23, 70], [24] ]
}
```

Notifications must include a `X-Ngsiv2-AttrsFormat` header with the value of `attrsFormat` of the associated subscription,
so notification receiver can know the format used without needing processing notification payload.

### Notification templates

Based on the "template" field defined as part of the subscription and in a macro replacement language
that could be used in "template" "callback", "headers" and "query". Details TBD.

## Group API Entry Point

### Retrieve API Resources [GET /v2]

This resource does not have any attributes. Instead it offers the initial
API affordances in the form of the links in the JSON body.

It is recommended to follow the “url” link values,
[Link](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) or Location headers where
applicable to retrieve resources. Instead of constructing your own URLs,
to keep your client decoupled from implementation details.

### Update attribute value [PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value{?type}]

The request payload is the new attribute value.

* If the request payload MIME type is `application/json`, then the value of the attribute is set to the JSON object or array
  coded in the payload (if the payload is not a valid JSON document, then an error is returned).
* If the request payload MIME type is `text/plain`, then the following algorithm is applied to the payload:
  * If the payload starts and ends with citation-marks (`"`), the value is taken as a string (the citation marks themselves are not
    considered part of the string)
  * If `true` or `false`, the value is taken as a boolean.
  * If `null`, the value is taken as null.
  * If these first three tests 'fail', the text is interpreted as a number.
  * If not a number, then an error is returned and the attribute's value is unchanged.

The payload MIME type in request is specified in the `Content-Type` HTTP header.

Response:

* Successful operation uses 204 No Content
* Errors use a non-200 and (optionally) an error payload. See subsection on Error Responses for more details.

## Entity type [/v2/types/{entityType}]

### Retrieve entity type [GET /v2/types/{entityType}]

The operation returns a JSON object with information about the type: `attrs` (the union set of attribute names along all
the entities of such type) and `count` (the number of entities belonging to that type).

Response code:

* Successful operation uses 200 OK
* Errors use a non-200 and (optionally) an error payload. See subsection on Error Responses for more details.

+ Parameters
    + entityType: Room (required, string) - Entity Type

+ Response 200 (application/json)

# Group Subscriptions

A subscription is represented by a JSON object with the following fields:

+ `id`: Subscription unique identifier. Automatically created at creation time.
+ `description` (optional): A free text used by the client to describe the subscription.
+ `subject`: It is an object that describes the subject of the subscription.
+ `notification`: It is an object that describes the notification received by the subscriber.
+ `expires`: Subscription expiration date in ISO8601 format. Permanent subscriptions must omit
   this field.
+ `status`: Either `active` (for active subscriptions) or `inactive` (for inactive subscriptions).
  If this field is not provided at subscription creation time, new subscriptions are created with
  the `active` status, which can be changed by clients afterwards. For expired subscriptions this
  attribute is set to `expired` value (no matter if the client updates it to `active`/`inactive`).

A `subject` contains the following subfields:

+ `entities`: A list of objects, each one composed of the following subfields (`id`/`idPattern` or `type` must be present):
    + `id` or `idPattern`: Id or pattern of the affected entities. Both cannot be used at the same time, but at least one of them must be set.
    + `type`: Type of the affected entities (optional).
+ `condition`: Condition that will trigger the notification. It can have two optional properties:
    + `attributes`: array of attribute names
    + `expression`: an expression composed of `q`, `georel`, `geometry` and `coords` (see "List entities" operation above
   about this field).

A `notification` object contains the following subfields:

+ `attributes`: List of attributes to be included in the notification message. If not specified (or empty), all attributes are included
  in the notification. It also defines the order in which attributes will appear in notifications when `attrsFormat` `value` is used
  (see "Notification messages" section).
+ `callback` : URL pointing to the service which will be invoked when a notification is generated. A NGSIv2
  compliant server must support `http` URL schema, other schemas (e.g. schemas for web sockets) could also be supported.
+ `headers` (optional): a key-map of HTTP headers that will be included in the notification messages. Note that this cannot be used
  to override headers that make the notification inconsistent (e.g. `Content-Type: application/json`).
+ `query` (optional): a key-map of URL query parameters that will be included in the notification message.
+ `attrsFormat` (optional): specifies how the entities will be represented in notifications. Accepted values are
  `normalized` (the one used if the field is omitted), `keyValues` or `values`. If `attrsFormat` takes any value different
  than those an error will be raised. See detail in "Notification messages" section.
+ `throttling`: Minimal period of time in seconds which must elapse between two consecutive notifications. It
  is optional.
+ `timesSent` (not editable, only in GET operations): Number of notifications sent due to this subscription.
+ `lastNotification`: Last notification date in ISO8601 format.

Notification rules are as follow:

* If `attributes` and `expression` are used, a notification is sent whenever one of the attributes in the `attributes` list changes and
  at the same time `expression` matches.
* If `attributes` is used and `expression` is not used, a notification is sent whenever one of the attributes in the `attributes` list changes-
* If `attributes` is not used and `expression` is used, a notification is sent whenever any of the attributes of the entity changes and
  at the same time `expression` matches.
* If neither `attributes` or `expression` are used, a notification is sent whenever any of the attributes of the entity changes.

# Group Registrations

Context Registration allows to associate external services to context data. One of the main
use cases of this functionality is the association of Context Providers.

A context registration is represented by a JSON object with the following fields:

+ `id`       : Unique identifier assigned to the registration. Automatically generated at creation time.
+ `subject`  : It is an object that describes the subject of the registration.
+ `callback` : URL which denotes the end point of the registered service. It is optional, as it can be
undefined under certain conditions, for instance, transient unavailability of the provider.
+ `metadata` : An optional JSON object which allows to associate extra metadata properties to the registration.
It must follow the same representation conventions as context attribute metadata (See JSON Attribute Representation). 
+ `duration` : Duration of the registration in ISO8601 format. Default duration is infinite.

A `subject` contains the following subfields:

+ `entities`: A list of objects, each one composed of the following subfields (`id`/`idPattern` or type must be present):
    + `id` or `idPattern`: Id or pattern of the affected entities. Both cannot be used at the same time, but at least one of them must be set.
    + `type`: Type of the affected entities (optional).
+ `attributes`: List of attributes to be provided (if not specified it would mean all).

### Register [POST /v2/op/register]

This operation allows to create, update and/or delete several registrations in a single batch operation.
The payload is an object with two properties:

+ `actionType`, to specify the kind of register action to do: either CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE.
+ `registrations`, an array of registration, each one specified using the JSON registration representation
  format (described in a section above). In the case of CREATE operation, the registration `id` must not be
  included.

Response:

* Successful operation uses 200 OK. In addition, in the case of successful CREATE, a list of IDs is returned,
  each one corresponding to the ID of the element in the request payload and in the same order.
* Errors use a non-200 and (optionally) an error payload. See subsection on Error Responses for more details.

          "actionType": "CREATE",
          "registrations": [

          "efgh"
        ]


### Discover [POST /v2/op/discover/{?limit,offset,options}]

The response payload is an Array which contains one object per matching registration. Each registration follows
the JSON registration representation format (described in a section above).

The payload may contain the following elements (all of them optional):

+ `entities`: a list of entites to search for. Each entity is represented by a JSON object with the following
  elements:
    + `id` or `idPattern` (both cannot be used at the same time): specifies the exact ID (in the case of `id`)
     or pattern (in the case of `idPattern`) of the entities to search for. If omitted, it means "any entity
     ID".
    + `type`: specifies the type of the entities to search for. If omitted, it means "any entity type".
+ `attributes`: a list of attributes names to search for. If omitted, it means "any attribute".
+ `scopes`: a list of scopes to restrict the results of the query. Each scope is represented by a JSON
   object with a `type` (a JSON string) and `value` (whose type depends on the `type` property). The
   different available scopes are described elsewhere.

Response code:

* Successful operation uses 200 OK
* Errors use a non-200 and (optionally) an error payload. See subsection on Error Responses for more details.

+ Parameters
    + limit: 10 (optional, number) - Limit the number of registrations to be retrieved
    + offset: 22 (optional, number) - Skip a number of registrations
    + options (optional, string) - Options dictionary
        + Members
          + count - when used, the total number of registrations is returned in the response as a HTTP header named `X-Total-Count`

# Group OMA-NGSI Operations

(The need/usefulness of these operations is currently under discussion)

For the sake of completeness here is an enumeration of the OMA-NGSI (9 & 10) operations. These
operations will be supported under the 'v2' resource as well.

### subscribeContext [POST /v2/subscribeContext]

(Not needed, a it is covered by the RESTful POST /v2/subscriptions operation)

### updateContextSubscription [POST /v2/updateContextSubscription]

(Not needed, a it is covered by the RESTful PATCH /v2/subscriptions operation)

### unsubscribeContext [POST /v2/unsubscribeContext]

(Not needed, a it is covered by the RESTful DELETE /v2/subscriptions operation)

### notifyContext [POST /v2/notifyContext]

(The payload of the v2 notifyContext should be described)

### subscribeContextAvailability [POST /v2/subscribeContextAvailability]

(Not needed as POJ RPC, but we need to define a RESTful operation for this, analogous to the NGSI10 one)

### updateContextAvailabilitySubscription [POST /v2/updateContextAvailabilitySubscription]

(Not needed as POJ RPC, but we need to define a RESTful operation for this, analogous to the NGSI10 one)

### unsubscribeContextAvailability [POST /v2/unsubscribeContextAvailability]

(Not needed as POJ RPC, but we need to define a RESTful operation for this, analogous to the NGSI10 one)

### notifyContextAvailability [POST /v2/notifyContextAvailability]

(The payload of the v2 notifyContextAvailability should be described)
