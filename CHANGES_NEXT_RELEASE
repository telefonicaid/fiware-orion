- Fix: missing lastSuccess/lastFailure associated to initial notification on subscription creation some times when csub cache is in use (#2974)
- Fix: several invalid memory accesses (based on a workaround, not a definitive solution, see issue #2994)
- Add: release_date and doc fields are added to the GET /version output to align with FIWARE scheme (#2970)
- Fix: broken JSON due to unscaped quotes (") in NGSIv2 error description field (#2955)
- Hardening: NGSIv1 responses don't use pretty-print JSON format any longer, as NGSIv2 responses work (potentially saving around 50% size) (#2760)
