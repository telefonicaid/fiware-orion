- Add: new value for URI param 'options' (options=noAttrDetail) for NGSIv2 queries to exclude attribute detail, making the query faster (#2073) 
- Fix: wrong type in previousValue metadata for notifications triggered by PUT /v2/entities/{id}/attrs/{name}/value (#2553)
- Fix: giving a semaphore in case of mongo exception, which was causing the broker to be unable to serve requests involving the database, and possibly even to crash due to lack of resources (#2571)
- Fix: avoid unused attribute type detail in NGSIv1 queries (which was making the queries slower) (#2073)
