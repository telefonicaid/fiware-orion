## Replica set configuration. Note that if you set this parameter, the BROKER_DATABASE_HOST
## is interpreted as the list of host (or host:port) separated by commas to use as
## replica set seed list (single element lists are also allowed). If BROKER_DATABASE_RPL_SET
## parameter is unset, Orion CB assumes that the BROKER_DATABASE_HOST is an stand-alone

#BROKER_DATABASE_PASSWORD=orion

# Use the following variable if you need extra ops

# We need to start the CB with log append mode to not overwrite previous logs and logrotate work correctly
BROKER_EXTRA_OPS="-multiservice -logAppend"
