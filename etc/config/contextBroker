# Configuration file for orion-broker
#
#####

# BROKER_USER - Who to run orion-broker as. Note that you may need to use root if you want
# to run Orion in a privileged port (<1024)
BROKER_USER=orion

# BROKER_PORT - the port/socket where orion-broker will listen for connections
BROKER_PORT=1026

# BROKER_LOG_DIR - Where to log to
BROKER_LOG_DIR=/var/log/contextBroker

# BROKER_LOG_LEVEL - Log File Level
BROKER_LOG_LEVEL=WARN

# BROKER_PID_FILE - Where to store the pid for orion-broker
BROKER_PID_FILE=/var/run/contextBroker/contextBroker.pid

## Database configuration for orion-broker
BROKER_DATABASE_HOST=localhost
BROKER_DATABASE_NAME=orion

## Replica set configuration. Note that if you set this parameter, the BROKER_DATABASE_HOST
## is interpreted as the list of host (or host:port) separated by commas to use as
## replica set seed list (single element lists are also allowed). If BROKER_DATABASE_RPL_SET
## parameter is unset, Orion CB assumes that the BROKER_DATABASE_HOST is an stand-alone
## mongod instance
#BROKER_DATABASE_RPLSET=orion_rs

# Database authentication (not needed if MongoDB doesn't use --auth)
#BROKER_DATABASE_USER=orion
#BROKER_DATABASE_PASSWORD=orion

# Use the following variable if you need extra ops
#BROKER_EXTRA_OPS="-t 0-255"
# We need to start the CB with log append mode to not overwrite previous logs and logrotate work correctly
BROKER_EXTRA_OPS="-multiservice -logAppend"

#### ADVANCED CONFIGURATION AREA ####

# The next environment variable generates, if it is defined as 'true', an archive in the 
# path /var/cb_cores with the core file and the logs when the process crash (the directory is
# automatically created if it doesn't previously exist). Use this parameter for debug purposes.
# In addition, take into account the following:
#   * BROKER_USER is ignored and contextBroker will be started by root user
#   * It is assumed bzip2 tool installed in the system
#   * Core generation requires CB to be launched with -fg and put in background at shell level
#     (i.e. "with ending &"). Note this is different from regular CB launch (i.e. not using -fg).
#     Check /etc/init.d/contextBroker for details
#   * The file names have the next format: /var/cb_cores/CB_core_yyyymmdd_HHMMSS.tar.bz2, e.g. /var/cb_cores/CB_core_220180108_151502.tar.bz2
#   * To avoid filling the disk only the last 8 cores and logs are maintained.
#   * Have a look to the coredump_watcher.sh script (can be found at Orion repo at https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/tree/master/scripts),
#     which can be used to send an email whenever a new core file is generated
GENERATE_COREDUMP=false
