# FIXME: Due to a bug in Orion, the forward provoked by the query of steps 5 and 11 make the broker send not one but TWO forwarded
#        request of the query to the accumulator.
#        This is an ancient bug of the broker and it is 'more or less acceptable', but should be fixed some day ...
#        Note that the queries in step 2 and 8 DO NOT provoke the bug.
#        This fact may be of help to locate the bug.
