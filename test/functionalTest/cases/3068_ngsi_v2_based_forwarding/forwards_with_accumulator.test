# FIXME: Due to a bug in Orion, the forward provoked by the query of steps 5 and 11 make the broker send not one but TWO forwarded
#        request of the query to the accumulator.
#        This is a bug of the broker that is also present in V1 forwarding and it is 'more or less acceptable', but should be fixed some day ...
#        Note that the queries in step 2 and 8 DO NOT provoke the bug.
#        This fact may be of help to locate the bug.
#
#
# FIXME: It seems like older versions of libcurl (CentOS 7 used version 7.29 of libcurl) contain a bug that makes the Content-Type
#        always be added to the sent message, also when the Content-Type is EMPTY (which should inhibit this behaviour).
#        The result of this bug is that the line
#          Content-Type:
#        is a part of forwarded messages.
#        In newer versions of libcurl this haqs been fixed (Ubuntu 18.04 uses libcurl 7.58)
#        For now, a "grep -v 'Content-Type'" is added to calls of accumulatorDump as a work-around.
#        The real fix would be to use a newer version of libcurl in CentOS 7 (Travis, Jenkins)
