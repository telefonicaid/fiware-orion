# 01. Registration of E1 without Legacy Forwarding, for the accumulator - forward to be in NGSIv2 format
# 02. Query of entities with id E1 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond, but a forward is provoked
# 03. Dump and reset the accumulator, see the forwarded query in NGSIv2 format
#
# FIXME: Due to a bug in Orion, the forward provoked by the query of step 2 makes the broker send not one but TWO forwarded
#        request of the query to the accumulator.
#        This is a bug of the broker that is also present in V1 forwarding and it is 'more or less acceptable', but should be fixed some day ...
