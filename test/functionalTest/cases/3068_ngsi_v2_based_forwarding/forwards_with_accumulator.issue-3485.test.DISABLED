# 01. Register entities of type T1, with ID .*, and attribute A1, for the accumulator
# 02. Query entities of type T1 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond
# 03. Dump the accumulator, see the forwarded query
# 04. Register entities of type T2, with ID .*, and no attributes, for the accumulator
# 05. Query entities of type T2 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond
# 06. Dump the accumulator, see the forwarded query
# 07. Register entities of type T3, with ID E1, and attribute A1, for the accumulator
# 08. Query entities of type T3 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond
# 09. Dump the accumulator, see the forwarded query
# 10. Register entities of type T4, with ID E1, and no attributes, for the accumulator
# 11. Query entities of type T4 - get empty response as the accumulator doesn't respond
# 12. Dump the accumulator, see the forwarded query
#
# FIXME: Due to a bug in Orion, the forward provoked by the query of steps 5 and 11 make the broker send not one but TWO forwarded
#        request of the query to the accumulator.
#        This is a bug of the broker that is also present in V1 forwarding and it is 'more or less acceptable', but should be fixed some day ...
#        Note that the queries in step 2 and 8 DO NOT provoke the bug.
#        This fact may be of help to locate the bug.
