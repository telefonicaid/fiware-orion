--NAME--
Bug in /v2/entities without options=keyValues

--SHELL-INIT--

#
# Issue #1716 reports that a normal v2 entity using "POST /v2/entities" and a payload of
# '{"type": "house", "id": "bathroom", "temperature": "34"}' crashes the broker.
# The payload is invalid, as the value of "temperature" would have to be a JSON object.
# [ the same payload is valid if '?options=keyValues' is used ]
# 
# 01. Normal (but erroneous) v2 entity creation without keyValues (without crashing the broker)
# 02. GET the entity to make sure the creation did NOT work
