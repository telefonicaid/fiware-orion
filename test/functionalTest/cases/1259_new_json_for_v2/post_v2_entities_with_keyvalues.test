#
# We now have two different ways of parsing "POST /v2/entities":
#
# 1. The 'old way', or "Normalized", which is the default parsing method:
#
# {
#   "id": "",
#   "type: "",
#   "attr1": {
#   },
#   "attr2: {
#   }
# }
#
# Note that the right-hand side for "attr" must be a JSON object, describing an attribute.
# It cannot be a JSON vector, nor an arbitrary JSON object.
# It can be an empty object though: {}, the meaning would be:
# - value:    null
# - type:     unchanged
# - metadata: unchanged
#
# If not empty, the JSON object must contain at least one of the three { value, type, metadata },
# otherwise it is considered a *compound value* and that is not valid in this mode (it is in ?options=keyValues).
#
#
# 2. The options=keyValues parsing method:
#
# {
#   "id": "",
#   "type: "",
#   "intAttr": 12,
#   "floatAttr": 3.14,
#   "vecAttr": [ ... ],
#   "objAttr": { "a": 3, "b": false },
#   "polemic1": { "value": 12, "type": 16 }
# }
#
# Pretty clear here. The only polemic part is the attribute called 'polemic1', it is just like
# a "normalized" attribute, but as options=keyValues is turned on, it should be understood as a compound.
# So, "type" is an integer and that is OK (would fail in normalized as "type" must be a string).
#
# Now to the metadatas.
# In "normalized mode", metadatas are parsed like the attributes, anything else would be confusing:
#
# {
#   "id": "",
#   "attr1": {
#     "metadata": {
#       "m1": {
#         "value": 24,
#         "type": "MT1
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# In keyValues mode, there are no metadata for attributes. If you need that, use the "normalized" method.
# 
#
# An example just for curiosity ...
#
# {
#   "id": "",
#   "type: "",
#   "attr1": {
#     "value": 39,
#     "type": "T1",
#     "metadata": {
#       "m1": {
#          "type": "MT1",
#          "value": [ 1, 2, 3 ]
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# In this example (remember, we're in keyValues mode), attr1 is understood as a compound object
# Note that compound values for metadatas are not implemented. So, had we been in "normalized" mode,
# this example would give a parse error, as m1 has a vector as a value.
# However, the whole thing is slallowed as a compound, as we are in keyValues mode ... :-)
#
#


#
# 01. POST /v2/entities?options=keyValues, creating compound E1/a1
# 02. POST /v2/entities, creating 'normal' E2/a1, same payload, just without options=keyValues
# 03. GET /v2/entities
# 04. GET /v2/entities?options=keyValues
#
# NOTE that E1/a1 has a compound value, as options=keyValues was used in step 01.
