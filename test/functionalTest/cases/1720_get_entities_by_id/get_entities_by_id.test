# The bug that this test covers was that step 4 returned vehicle1,
# vehicle2 and vehicle 3 entities. Steps 5 and beyond are hardening of
# the base case
#
# 01. Create entity vehicle1
# 02. Create entity vehicle2
# 03. Create entity vehicle3
# 04. Query for id=vehicle -> no result
# 05. Query for id=vehicle1 -> vehicle1
# 06. Query for id=vehicle1,vehicle3 -> vehicle1->vehicle3
