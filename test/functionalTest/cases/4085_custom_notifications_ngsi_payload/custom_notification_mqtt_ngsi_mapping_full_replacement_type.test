# This delay before asking for accumulator dump was introduced when we

# in PR https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/pull/4302. For some
# unknown reason in ubuntu-22.04 fails if we don't add this. It doesn't make
# sense to me (both Orion and mosquitto runs in containers on top of ubuntu OS)
# but it happens... (maybe some kind of networking effect in the docker host?)
