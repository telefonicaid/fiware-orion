--NAME--
Creation of a complex context in the context server, then obtaining it 

--SHELL-INIT--

--SHELL--

#
# 01. Create an entity with a complex context (inline) and Accept: application/json - see served context in Link Header
# 02. Obtain the context from the Link header
#

#
# For some reason REGEX inside the Link header to 'null out' $HOST:$PORT doesn't work.
# So, instead, as inside this script we know the hostname and the port, we use 'sed' to substitute the hostname with the static string "HOST"
# and the port with the static string "PORT".
#
# If you look down in the REGEXPECT part of "01. Create an entity with a complex context ...", you see the Link header like this:
#   Link: <http://IP:PORT/ngsi-ld/ex/v1/contexts/urn:volatile:1>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"
# which is the modified Link line after sed substitution of hostname and port
#
hostName=$(hostname)
