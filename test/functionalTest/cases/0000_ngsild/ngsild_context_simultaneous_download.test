#
# This test exercises the 'wait for context download feature', implemented in end of February 2021, by ...
# - Sending a request to create an entity E1 with context X, in the bacground, so another request can enter the broker simultaneously
# - Sending another request, with the same context X, to create another entity (E2)
#
# As the first request is already downloading context X when the second request is received, the second request will await the download of
# context X. Finally, both request will succeed.
#
# Context X: https://fiware.github.io/NGSI-LD_TestSuite/ldContext/testContext.jsonld
#
#
# 01. Create entity E1, with context X - in the background
# 02. Simultaneously, create entity E2, using the same context
# 03. Sleep a second, just in case. Should not be necessary
# 04. GET all entities - make sure both E1 and E2 have been created
#
