# We found a "funny" problem, really it's a user error, but the broker needs to protect itself against it.
# Scenario:
#   1. CP1 registers (in CB) entities of type "Vehicle" - no more hints in the registration - Registration R1
#   2. An entity urn:E1 is created in CP1, with type "Building"
#   3. CB receives an Entity Retieve request for the entity urn:E1, from an "end-user"
#      - There's no entity type info, just the Entity ID, so, the registration R1 matches, as it has no Entity ID info, just the Entity Type
#   4. CB sends the forwarded request to GET /entities/urn:E1
#   5. CP1 responds with urn:E1, exactly what was asked for
#   6. CB responds to the "end-user" with the entity urn:E1 - all good?
#
#   No, it's NOT "all good", as CP1 only retgistered entities of type "Vehicle", but urn:E1 is of the type "Building" ...
#
#   In order to fix this problem, we've added the URI param "type" to GET /entities/{entityId}
#   If the entity exists in CB, the entity type will be added to the forwarded request and the "misunderstanding" is fixed.
#   If the entity DOES NOT exists in CB, the problem will still occur, BUT, the initial request can be sent with the URI param type=Building.
#   That fixes the probem, because R1 is no longer a match, as CB now knows the entity type "Building" and "R1" only exposes entities of type "Vehicle"
#
# TEST 1 - the "failure"
# 01. Registration R1 in CB, for CP1, entity type "Vehicle"
# 02. Create entity urn:E1 in CP1, with entity type "Building"
# 03. GET /entities/urn:E1 in CB, get urn:E1 (with type Building) from CP1
#
# TEST 2 - fixing it by doing the GET with the entity type 'Building'
# 04. GET /entities/urn:E1?type=Building in CB - see nothing
#
# TEST 3 - fixing it by having the entity locally
# 05. Create entity urn:E1 in CB, with entity type "Building"
# 06. GET /entities/urn:E1 - see only local data
