# FIXME: in Debian 11 IP is 0.0.0.0 while in Debian 12 is 127.0.0.1. This could be due to changes in how
# curl (used internally by orionCurl) works, from 7.74 (Debian 11) to 7.88 (Debian 12) (it wouldn't be
# the only change, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/77045755/1485926 ;). I have tried to fix
# using explictely 'curl --interface 0.0.0.0' in orionCurl function, but it doesn't work. Thus, the
# alternative is to use a REGEX() so both IP options get covered. This can be seen as a temporal fix, so
# when we decide to remove compatibility with Debian 11 we can remove the REGEX() and leave only one way
# (it seems we have already used this trick is other .test files, look for '0.0.0.0|127.0.0.1' text pattern,
# maybe all them could be removed at the same time)
