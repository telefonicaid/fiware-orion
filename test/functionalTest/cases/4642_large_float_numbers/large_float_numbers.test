# We are using the the limits included in the IEEE754 standard. However, note that
# min non zero cases are rounded to 0 due to how double2string() function is implemented
# (ten digits precision). We could remove that rounding, but consecuences may not be7
# backward compatible (eg. places where we have now 1.7 could become in 1.666666666666666666669)
