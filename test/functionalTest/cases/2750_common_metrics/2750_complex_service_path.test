# 01. Send a GET /v2/entities with service path /A1/#
# 02. Send a GET /v2/entities with service path /A2,/B2
# 03. Send a GET /v2/entities with service path /#
# 04. Send a GET /v2/entities without service path (/# is used as service path)
# 05. Ask for Metrics, see A1 and A2 as service paths, as well as two 'root service path'
#
# NOTE
# Under valgrind, a GET /version is issued to the broker initially, to check it's alive.
# This "screws" the statistics a little (especially as the /version payload is big and not with a fixed size)
# and some REGEX have been necessary for this test to run both as normal functest and under valgrind
