--NAME--
Large request - starting the broker to accept very large requests

--SHELL-INIT--
dbInit CB
brokerStart CB 0-255 IPV4 -inReqPayloadMaxSize 50000000

--SHELL--
#
# Creating a file of ~40 MB.
# The default max size of a request is 1 MB but the broker is started with -inReqPayloadMaxSize 50000000 (~50 MB), and a ~40 MB request must be permitted
#
HUGEFILE=$(mktemp)
tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom  2>/dev/null |  head -c 40000000 > $HUGEFILE
#
# Note that we are not including an actual JSON payload, but in this test what matters
# is the size, not the format of the data.
#
# As the HUGE payload is accepted, size-wise, it will be parsed and a Parse Error will be the result
#
