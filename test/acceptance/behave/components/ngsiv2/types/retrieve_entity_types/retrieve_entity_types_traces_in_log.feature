Feature: verify fields in log traces with retrieve entity types request using NGSI v2.
  As a context broker user
  I would like to verify fields in log traces with retrieve entity types request using NGSI v2
  So that I can manage and use them in my scripts

  Actions Before the Feature:
  Setup: update properties test file from "epg_contextBroker.txt" and sudo local "false"
  Setup: update contextBroker config file
  Setup: start ContextBroker
  Check: verify contextBroker is installed successfully
  Check: verify mongo is installed successfully

  Actions After each Scenario:
  Setup: delete database in mongo

  Actions After the Feature:
  Setup: stop ContextBroker
