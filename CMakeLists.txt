# Baseline compiler flags, any change here will affect all build types

# FIXME #3775 currently the only place in which std::auto_ptr<std::auto_ptr> is being used
# is the code in commonMocks.h. Thus. probably this can be removed and #2979 definitively solved.
#
# FIXME P4: https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/issues/2979
#   'template class std::auto_ptr' is deprecated in gcc 6.3.0 of Ubuntu 17.04, so -Werror cannot be used alone, at least not for now.
#
#   The *real* fix would be to rewrite the part of the code producing these warnings, but for now,
#   disabling the -Werror flag makes the problem go away (warnings will still be found and give errors in other distros).
#
#   One example of this warning (there are many warnings, but as in header files, just a few places):
#
#   mongoBackend/safeMongo.h:
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------
#     extern bool nextSafeOrError
#     (
#       const std::auto_ptr<mongo::DBClientCursor>&  cursor,
#       ...
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A grep of 'std::auto_ptr<' in the header files show 7 hits, and 13 hits in cpp files
#
# In PR https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/pull/3069, a workaround for Ubuntu is implemented.
# This workaround consists of putting back the -Werror flag and instead solving the problem by
# adding another flag: -Wno-deprecated-declarations

    # OLD:
    #   Note that stack protection is activated only in debug compilation.
    #   This is due that this directive makes the compiler introduce code at the beginning/end of each functions,
    #   so it has a pretty big impact on performance
    #
    #   Our unit tests don't pass the compilation with "stack protection", so we turn it off using
    #   remove_definitions().

    #
    # NEW:
    #   The option -fstack-check makes valgrind report false positives (millions) in CentOS 6.
    #   This makes the output impossible to use and we have decided to remove these two options (both of them).
    #   The cause seems to be a bug in the compiler (gcc 4.4.7), fixed in some moment between that version 
    #   and gcc 4.7.2 (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44758939/unexpected-valgrind-invalid-write-when-fstack-check-is-used
    #   for more detail). However, we don't want to use a compiler that is not meant for CentOS 6,
    #   which is the official distro for the context broker, so, we simply remove this option.
    #   They may be reinstated once Orion context broker updates the official distro to be CentOS 7 (which uses gcc 4.8.5)
