## Introduction

This is the code repository for the Orion Context Broker, the reference implementation of the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker GE.

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://www.fiware.org). Check also the [FIWARE Catalogue entry for Orion](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/publishsubscribe-context-broker-orion-context-broker)

Any feedback on this documentation is highly welcome, including bugs, typos
or things you think should be included but aren't. You can use [github issues](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/issues/new) to provide feedback.

You can find the User & Programmer's Manual and the Installation & Administration Manual on [readthedocs.org](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.org)

## GEi overall description

Orion is a C++ implementation of the NGSI9/10 REST API binding developed as a part of the FIWARE platform.

Orion Context Broker allows you to manage all the whole lifecycle of context information including updates, queries, registrations and subscriptions. It is an NGSI9/10 server implementation to manage context information and its availability. Using the Orion Context Broker, you are able to register context elements and manage them through updates and queries. In addition, you can subscribe to context information so when some condition occurs (e.g. the context elements have changed) you receive a notification. These usage scenarios and the Orion Context Broker features are described in this document.

If this is your first contact with the Orion Context Broker, it is highly recommended to have a look to the brief [Quick Start guide](doc/manuals/quick_start_guide.md).

## API Overview

In order to create an entity (Room1) with two attributes (temperature and pressure):

``` 
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST -d @- <<EOF
{
  "id": "Room2",
  "type": "Room",
  "temperature": {
    "value": 23,
    "type": "Number"
  },
  "pressure": {
    "value": 720,
    "type": "Number"
  }
}
EOF
``` 
In order to query the entity:

    curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2 -s -S --header 'Accept: application/json' | python -mjson.tool

In order to update one of the entity atributes (temperature):
``` 
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2/attrs/temperature -s -S \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X PUT -d @- <<EOF
{
  "value": 26.3,
  "type": "Number"
}
EOF
``` 

or (more compact):
```
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2/attrs/temperature/value -s -S \
    --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
    -X PUT -d 26.3
```

Please have a look at the [Quick Start guide](doc/manuals/quick_start_guide.md) if you want to test these operations in an actual public instance of Orion Context Broker. In addition, have a look to the API Walkthrough and API Reference sections below in order to know more details about the API (subscriptions, registrations, etc.).
