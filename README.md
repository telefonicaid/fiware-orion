The Orion Context Broker is an implementation of the Publish/Subscribe Context
Broker GE, providing an
[NGSI](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
interface. Using this interface, clients can do several operations:

-   Query context information. The Orion Context Broker stores context
    information updated from applications, so queries are resolved based
    on that information. Context information consists on *entities* (e.g. a car)
    and their *attributes* (e.g. the speed or location of the car).
-   Update context information, e.g. send updates of temperature
-   Get notified when changes on context information take place (e.g. the
    temperature has changed)
-   Register context provider applications, e.g. the provider for the temperature sensor within a
    room

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information

### Description

Orion is a C++ implementation of the NGSIv2 REST API binding developed as a part
of the FIWARE platform.

Orion Context Broker allows you to manage the entire lifecycle of context
information including updates, queries, registrations and subscriptions. It is
an NGSIv2 server implementation to manage context information and its availability.
Context information consists on *entities* (e.g. a car) and their *attributes*
(e.g. the speed or location of the car).

Using the Orion Context Broker, you are able to create context elements and manage
them through updates and queries. In addition, you can subscribe to context
information so when some condition occurs (e.g. the context elements have changed)
you receive a notification. These usage scenarios and the Orion Context Broker
features are described in this documentation.

If this is your first contact with the Orion Context Broker, it is highly
recommended to have a look to the brief
[Quick Start guide](doc/manuals/quick_start_guide.md).

## Install

Build and Install documentation for Orion Context Broker can be found at
[the corresponding section of the Admin Manual](doc/manuals/admin/install.md).

> :point_right: If you want to run a production-grade instance of orion, carefully read all information in the [admin-section](doc/manuals/admin).

## Running

How to run Orion Context Broker can be found at
[the corresponding section of the Admin Manual](doc/manuals/admin/running.md).

## Usage

In order to create an entity (Room1) with two attributes (temperature and
pressure):

```console
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities -s -S --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST -d @- <<EOF
{
  "id": "Room2",
  "type": "Room",
  "temperature": {
    "value": 23,
    "type": "Number"
  },
  "pressure": {
    "value": 720,
    "type": "Number"
  }
}
EOF
```

In order to query the entity:

```console
    curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2 -s -S --header 'Accept: application/json' | python -mjson.tool
```

In order to update one of the entity atributes (temperature):

```console
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2/attrs/temperature -s -S \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X PUT -d @- <<EOF
{
  "value": 26.3,
  "type": "Number"
}
EOF
```

or (more compact):

```console
curl <orion_host>:1026/v2/entities/Room2/attrs/temperature/value -s -S \
    --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
    -X PUT -d 26.3
```

Please have a look at the [Quick Start guide](doc/manuals/quick_start_guide.md)
if you want to test these operations in an actual public instance of Orion
Context Broker. In addition, have a look to the API Walkthrough and API
Reference sections below in order to know more details about the API
(subscriptions, registrations, etc.).

### Are there any legal issues with AGPL 3.0? Is it safe for me to use?

There is absolutely no problem in using a product licensed under AGPL 3.0. Issues with GPL
(or AGPL) licenses are mostly related with the fact that different people assign different
interpretations on the meaning of the term “derivate work” used in these licenses. Due to this,
some people believe that there is a risk in just _using_ software under GPL or AGPL licenses
(even without _modifying_ it).

For the avoidance of doubt, the owners of this software licensed under an AGPL-3.0 license
wish to make a clarifying public statement as follows:

> Please note that software derived as a result of modifying the source code of this
> software in order to fix a bug or incorporate enhancements is considered a derivative
> work of the product. Software that merely uses or aggregates (i.e. links to) an otherwise
> unmodified version of existing software is not considered a derivative work, and therefore
> it does not need to be released as under the same license, or even released as open source.
