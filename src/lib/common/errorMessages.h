/* FIXME P5: the current set of defines in this file doesn't cover all the possible cases we have in the code.
 * The unhardwiring work should continue, specially with regards to BadRequest errors (we have *a lot* of them
 * in the code.
 *
 * In addition, by the moment we are using this constants only for error payloads, but maybe they should be
 * also used for alarm error mensajes, e.g. alarmMgr.badInput(clientIp, ERROR_DESC_PARSE) instead of
 * alarmMgr.badInput(clientIp, "JSON parse error").
